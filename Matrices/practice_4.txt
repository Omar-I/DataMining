You have been supplied data for two more additional in-game statistics:
* Free Throws
* Free Throws Attempts

You need to create three plots that portray the following insights:
* Free Throw Attempts per game
* Accurancy of Free Throws
* Player playing style (2 vs 3 points preference) excluding Free Throws

- Each Free Throw is worth 1 point

The data has been supplied in the form of vectors. You will have to create
two matrices before you proceed with the analysis.
